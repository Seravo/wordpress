# Seravo WordPress
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Seravo/wordpress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Seravo/wordpress)

Brought to you by [Seravo.com](https://seravo.com).

A WordPress project layout for use with Git, Composer and Nginx. It also includes a config for an opinionated Vagrant box.

This same project layout is used by default on all [Seravo.com](https://seravo.com) instances for easy deployment workflow. Contents of this repository equals to what you would have on the server in the directory /data/wordpress/.

## Documentation

Please see our documentation at https://seravo.com/docs/ for more info.

## Installation

### MacOS

1. [Install Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)
2. [Install Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/)
3. [Install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
4. Clone this repo
5. Run the installation in terminal:
```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater vagrant-triggers vagrant-bindfs
$ vagrant up
```

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

To use virtualbox make sure you have ```vt-x``` enabled in your bios.

```
sudo apt-get install -y vagrant virtualbox virtualbox-dkms
git clone https://github.com/Seravo/wordpress ~/wordpress-dev
cd ~/wordpress-dev
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater vagrant-triggers vagrant-bindfs
vagrant up
```

### Linux (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora)

Add RPMFusion repositories. See  [RpmFusion](http://rpmfusion.org/). Repository is
needed for Virtualbox.

Clone the wordpress Git repo and run following commands:

```
sudo yum install vagrant virtualbox ruby-devel
sudo gem update bundler
sudo gem install hittimes -v '1.2.2'
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater vagrant-triggers vagrant-bindfs
sudo modprobe vboxdrv #Need to load the kernel module for virtualbox, you may want to load it automatically on boot...
vagrant up
```

### Linux (General)

If you get errors related to creating host-only network adapters during vagrant up, run ```sudo vboxreload```.
It seems that sometimes virtualbox kernel modules are not working correctly after the machine wakes up from sleep.


### Windows (Cygwin)

To use virtualbox make sure you have ```vt-x``` enabled in your bios.
You might need to disable ```hyper-v``` in order to use virtualbox.

1. [Install Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/) (**1.7.4 or later**)
2. [Install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
3. Clone this repo
4. Do the installation in terminal:
```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater vagrant-triggers
$ vagrant up

In theory, Seravo WordPress should work even without cygwin installed, but we strongly recommend using Cygwin for doing WordPress development on Windows machines.

## Development

The layout of this repo is designed in a way which allows you to open source your site without exposing any confidential data. By default all sensitive data is ignored by git.

All plugins are handled by composer so they are ignored by git. If you create custom plugins, force add them to git so that they are tracked or add new lines into .gitignore to not ignore.

Example of not ignore line in .gitignore: ```!htdocs/wp-content/plugins/your-plugin/```

If you create custom themes, they are automatically tracked in git.

Best way to develop custom plugins and themes is to add them into their own repositories and install them by composer.
You can do this by adding ```composer.json``` for your plugin/theme and then requiring them in your project like:

```json
"repositories": [
  {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url": "https://github.com/your-name/custom-plugin.git"
  }
],
"require": {
    "your-name/custom-plugin": "*"
}
```

## Updates
Vagrant will let you know as soon as a new version of the Vagrant box is available. You may download the newest box via `$ vagrant box update`

To update your vagrant to use the new image run:
```
$ vagrant box update
$ vagrant destroy
$ vagrant up
```

## Configuration

### config.yml
Change `name` in config.yml to change your site name. This is used in quite some places in development environment.

Add `production => domain` and `production => ssh_port` to sync with your production instance.

Add new domains under `development => domains` before first vagrant up to have extra domains.

See `config-sample.yml` for more

## The Layout

The root of this repository equals the contents of the directory ```/data/wordpress``` in the Seravo.com instance.

## WordPress plugins

The composer.json contains some plugins and themes that are likely to be useful for pretty much every installation. For particular use cases see our list of recommended plugins at http://wp-palvelu.fi/lisaosat/

Note that all plugins are installed, but not active by default. To activate them, run `vagrant ssh -c "wp plugin activate --all"`.
